## Development Environment Setup

### AutoPort Project Setup
```bash
# Virtual environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # Linux/Mac
# or
venv\Scripts\activate     # Windows

# Dependencies
pip install fastapi uvicorn sqlalchemy asyncpg alembic pydantic

# Database setup
alembic init alembic
alembic revision --autogenerate -m "Initial migration"
alembic upgrade head

# Run development server
uvicorn main:app --reload --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
```

### Database Configuration

- Alembic for migrations
- SQLAlchemy 2.0 async patterns

---

## Technical Preferences & Patterns

### Code Style Preferences
- **FastAPI**: Prefer dependency injection patterns
- **SQLAlchemy**: Use async patterns with proper session management
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive HTTPException usage with proper status codes
- **Logging**: Structured logging with context information
- **Validation**: Pydantic models for all request/response validation

### Architecture Patterns
- **Repository Pattern**: CRUD operations in separate modules
- **Service Layer**: Business logic in service functions
- **Event-Driven**: Notifications and side effects after main operations
- **Role-Based Access**: Proper authorization at endpoint level

### API Design Principles
- **RESTful**: Consistent resource-based URLs
- **Versioning**: API versioning strategy (/api/v1/)
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive OpenAPI documentation
- **Testing**: Unit and integration test patterns

---

## Common Code Snippets & Patterns

### FastAPI Dependency Pattern
```python
from typing import Annotated
from fastapi import Depends
from auth.dependencies import get_current_active_user

async def endpoint(
    current_user: Annotated[User, Depends(get_current_active_user)],
    db: Annotated[AsyncSession, Depends(get_db)]
):
    # Implementation
```

### SQLAlchemy Async Query Pattern
```python
result = await session.execute(
    select(Model)
    .options(selectinload(Model.relationship))
    .where(Model.field == value)
)
model = result.scalar_one_or_none()
```

### Error Handling Pattern
```python
try:
    # Database operations
    await session.flush()
    await session.refresh(obj)
    return obj
except HTTPException:
    raise
except Exception as e:
    logger.error(f"Error: {e}", exc_info=True)
    raise HTTPException(
        status_code=status.HTTP_500_INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR,
        detail="An error occurred."
    )
```
